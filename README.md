# ParentPortal

A full stack communication medium allowing users - teachers, parents & school administration, to collaborate and communicate student assignments and school administration announcements. I was motivated to build the project after talking to a family member about how difficult it was to keep in contact with her child's teacher during the Coronavirus pandemic. 

Parents can view announcements sent by adminstration staff. They are also able to view assignments posted by teachers with the ability to 'acknowledge' the assignment and comment on it. There is a school wide message board for parents, teachers and staff to communicate items not specific to announcements or assignments. 

Teachers are able to view "staff only" announcements from the school as well as announcements to parents from school administration. They can upload upcoming assignment images and a text description for the parents to review. Teachers and parents can comment on the assignment.

Administration is able to view and post new announcements but these users do not have access to assignments. They are also responsible for approving or denying new user requests under the Profile section.
