# ParentPortal

A communication medium that allows 2 users, teacher & parent, to collaborate and communicate student assignments and school administration notes. Teachers can upload upcoming assignments (PDFs or images) for the parent to review. Teachers and parents can comment on the assignment. Teachers will be able to view "staff only" announcements from the school as well as announcements to Parents from school administration. There is also a section for messaging between users.
